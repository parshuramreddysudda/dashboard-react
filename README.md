This is React project is based on [CRUD Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)  built with Redux, Prism , 
Material Design, amcharts and is equipped with RBAC.
</div>

## Prerequisites

All the packages are included in ```package.json``` file. So you can run the project with out any other dependencies.

## Getting Started

You can view a live demo over at   `` `Link Here` ``

To get the frontend running locally:

* Clone this repo
* `npm install` to install all req'd dependencies
* `npm start` to start the local server (this project uses npx create-react-app my-app)
* `npm run prism` to start serving the mock data for our project()

React project would be running on port ```3000``` and our Prism would be working on ```4010``` port so make sure respective ports are free of any other process.

 ## Prism Mock Server 

Prism is an  HTTP mock server that can mimic your APIâ€™s behavior as if you already built it. In this project Mock HTTP servers are generated from your OpenAPI v3 documents. I have  used Yaml configuration files to serve prism. You can check the files in ` `PrismFiles` ` folder from Project Dir.

``npm run prism`` 

Helps to start the prism server. You can check the responce from the execution script of the prism using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or any of your favourite  brower or API testing app.

<!-- All the files served to prism are written in yaml files. So please edit if you are awareo -->
